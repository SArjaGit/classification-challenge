# classification-challenge

* This Project is to analyze the dataset given by an ISP
  and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.
* Two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam are used in this project.
* The models that is used are
  * logistic regression model 
  * Random forest model.

* The accuracy score for Logistic Regression Model is 91.9%
* The accurancy score for Random Forest Classifier Model is 95.5%

* The Random Forest Classifier Model is better to be used in this case for detecting spam emails as per the given data set.
